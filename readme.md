This research focuses primarily on multivariate time series data analysis. The core model architecture adopted is MEMTO (as presented in the NeurIPS 2023 paper), leveraging prototype learning to more effectively handle previously unseen time series patterns.

Several comparative methodologies are being explored, including basic autoencoders, LSTM encoders, MEMTO (as the benchmark), and an integrated MEMTO+TSTCC approach.

Additional research topics and methods may be included and continuously updated as the study progresses.

The performance evaluation metric employed here is based on the VUS measure introduced in the 2025 paper, "VUS: Effective and Efficient Accuracy Measures for Time-Series Anomaly Detection."
